File Renamer
=============

## Why This Project?
I'm trying out the different file methods in Node.js.

Renaming files can be messy and time consuming and since javascript is my fav (ok, only language so far), I want to use Node.js to do this task. 

## To Run:

node app.js

## Note:

Be sure to change the doc names to the appropriate file names

## Extra Note:

This only renames one file.

Trying out how to rename a bunch of files next!
